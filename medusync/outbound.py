"""This site → Medusa.

One wildcard `doc_events` hook covers every doctype (see hooks.py); the
per-doctype decision is made here, at runtime, from Medusync Mapping
rows. That is what lets an operator add a new synced doctype from the
Desk UI without an app release. The same hook asks the configured handler
packs whether they want the event, so no business doctype is named in
hooks.py at all.

Multi-site
----------
A mapping with no site is sent to every enabled Medusync Site; one pinned
to a site is sent only there. Each site gets its own log row, its own
secret and its own retry schedule, so an outage at one store cannot stall
another.

Loop prevention
---------------
An inbound write from Medusa lands as an ordinary document save, which
would fire this hook and push the change straight back.
`frappe.flags.medusync_inbound` covers the part of that which happens
inside the request. What it cannot cover is the part a background worker
sends moments later, so an inbound write also leaves a breadcrumb on the
document (see medusync.echo); anything we send about that document within
the window is stamped `echo_of` and the far side drops it as its own.

Retries
-------
`frappe.enqueue` cannot delay a job, so a failed delivery is *parked*:
the log row keeps `status = Queued` and gets a `next_attempt_at`. The
once-a-minute sweep `medusync.tasks.retry_due` re-enqueues rows whose
time has come. Attempts exhausted → `Poison`, which is never retried
automatically.
