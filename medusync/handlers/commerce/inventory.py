# ERPNext -> Medusa stock levels. One-way: ERPNext owns stock and is the
# SINGLE reservation authority. We push SELLABLE = actual - reserved - safety
# (not raw actual_qty), so Medusa never oversells.
#
# Many warehouses, many stores. Which warehouse feeds which store, and under
# which stock-location id, is the map on Medusync Site (see medusync.warehouses).
# One warehouse can feed several stores under different ids, and each store is
# told its own; a warehouse nobody mapped is skipped before any work is done.
#
# Two triggers:
#   - Stock Ledger Entry.after_insert  -> actual_qty changed (receipts/issues)
#   - Sales Order submit/cancel/update -> reserved_qty changed (no SLE fires)
# Both defer to an after-commit job `push_level` that reads the settled Bin
# (at after_insert neither Bin nor qty_after_transaction is final).
