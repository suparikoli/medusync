"""Try a mapping before you trust it.

A mapping is a small program somebody wrote in a form. Until now the only
way to learn what it did was to save a real document and read the log
afterwards — a poor place to discover a wrong field name, and a worse one
to discover a condition that excludes everything.

This module answers three questions without touching anything:

    what does a record on this side look like?   sample_for / fields_of
    what would we send?                          dry_run_outbound
    what would arrive do?                        dry_run_inbound

The dry runs share their decisions with the real paths rather than
re-deriving them: outbound calls the same `build_payload` and the same
condition and selection checks, inbound calls the same `plan_inbound`
that `apply_inbound` executes. A studio that reasons independently is
worse than no studio, because it is believed.

"Touches nothing" is the load-bearing claim. Validation is the one place
that has to run real document code, so it runs inside a savepoint that is
always rolled back, with the inbound flag set so no hook of ours reacts
to it.
