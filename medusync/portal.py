"""What the Mappings page shows.

The two systems hold one configuration between them, so the two lists of it
should read the same. The Medusa admin has always shown a table — name,
which entity, which doctype, which way, how many pairs, when it last ran,
and a switch. This side showed a stock Frappe list view: titles, a Status
column and nothing about what any row actually does.

These are the same columns as that table, computed here rather than in the
page, so the two lists agree on what a mapping *is* without the page
knowing anything about the doctype's shape.
